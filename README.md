# Database-Manager
In this project I have tried to create a basic Database Management System, using Python. It's a rudimentary system that can just read '.csv' files, present in
the same directory as the code. 

The application can perform the following tasks :

    1.) Create new files.
    2.) Edit existing 'csv' files.
    3.) Display 'csv' files.
    4.) Check whether a certain file exists or not.

Some sample commands are :

    1.) create/ct/1
    2.) show/sh/2
    3.) edit/ed/3
    4.) quit/q/0

Just to be care, there is still a lot that I would want to add in this file in the near future, and also possibly provide a GUI for it, since as of yet this just
runs on the command prompt.
